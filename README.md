# LLM-Based Intelligent Chatbot

This project is an intelligent chatbot that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide accurate and meaningful answers to user queries across multiple domains.

## Description
The chatbot leverages a Large Language Model to understand natural language input and generate human-like responses.  
Unlike rule-based chatbots, this chatbot can handle open-ended questions and provide information on various topics such as education, technology, general knowledge, and more.

## Key Features
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Human-like responses using LLM
- Supports general-purpose information
- Context-aware conversations
- Scalable and flexible architecture

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Large Language Model (LLM)
- NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- API integration (OpenAI / Hugging Face / Local LLM)

## How It Works
1. User enters a question
2. The input is processed using NLP techniques
3. The LLM analyzes the context and intent
4. A relevant and meaningful response is generated
5. The response is displayed to the user
